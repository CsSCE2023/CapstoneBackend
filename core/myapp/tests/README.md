## Purpose

There are going to be tests to insure that chnages in the code does not change properties of the website. Although there are pre-commit tests in-place, they do not test for the purpose of the code. We will test URLs, Models and Views(maybe) of the project to have the desired outcome. 

* This folder will be moved outside of any app to contain all the necessary tests in one place.
